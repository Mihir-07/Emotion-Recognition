# Emotion-Recognition
The aim of proposed work is to classify the speech motion based on five categories such as happiness, surprise, anger, neutral state, sadness, etc. To handle the classification as multi class problem is proposed here. This is achieved by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm


# KeyFeatures
Speech is the most direct and natural method of communication between humans, and even between human and machine.
However, we still cannot achieve natural interaction between humans and machines because the current machines cannot sufficiently understand the emotional status of humans. 
This discrepancy has led to a new research field: speech emotion recognition.
The proposed work focus on the algorithm analyzing speech characteristics and apply deep learning (DL) algorithm to recognize underlying emotions.
Generally speaking, according to the emotion conceptualization, speech emotion recognition systems can be divided into two categories: continuous-label emotion recognition, and discrete-label emotion recognition. Early research on discrete speech emotion focused mainly on selecting speech acoustic features that can represent different emotions. Thus, many short- and long-term acoustic features combining static mathematics formulas have been proposed.
